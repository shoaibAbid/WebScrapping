# Web Scraping and Automation Scripts

This repository contains Python scripts for web scraping and automation tasks using the Selenium library. Below, you'll find information on both scripts:

## YouTube Channel Scraper

### Overview

The "YouTube Channel Scraper" script is designed to scrape data from the Social Blade website and gather information on the top 50 most viewed YouTube channels. It extracts data such as channel username, number of uploads, and total views for each channel and stores this information in a CSV file for further analysis or reference.

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-channel-scraper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd youtube-channel-scraper
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

   ```bash
   pip install csv
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python youtube_scraper.py
   ```

5. The script will fetch data from the Social Blade website and create a CSV file named 'youtubers.csv' in the same directory with the extracted information.

## Facebook Registration Automation

### Overview

The "Facebook Registration Automation" script utilizes the Selenium library to automate the process of creating a new Facebook account. It simulates the steps of providing user information and registering for a Facebook account, including filling in the first name, last name, email, password, birthdate, and gender fields.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. Python installed on your system.
2. Selenium library installed. You can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install selenium
   ```

3. ChromeDriver: You need to download the appropriate ChromeDriver executable for your Chrome browser version and provide its path in the script. You can download ChromeDriver from [here](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads).

### Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/facebook-registration-automation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd facebook-registration-automation
   ```

3. Edit the script to set the correct `PATH` for your ChromeDriver executable.

   ```python
   PATH = "C:\Program Files (x86)\chromedriver.exe"  # Replace with your ChromeDriver path
   ```

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python facebook_registration.py
   ```

5. The script will open a Chrome browser window, navigate to Facebook's registration page, and fill in the required information. It will then click the "Sign Up" button to register a new Facebook account.

## Important Notes

- Ensure you have the necessary ChromeDriver version installed and the path is correctly set in the "Facebook Registration Automation" script.
- The "YouTube Channel Scraper" script provides a basic example of web scraping and may need adjustments based on changes to the Social Blade website's structure.

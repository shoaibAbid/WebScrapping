# YouTube Channel Scraper

## Overview

This Python script is designed to scrape data from the Social Blade website and gather information on the top 50 most viewed YouTube channels. It extracts data such as channel username, number of uploads, and total views for each channel and stores this information in a CSV file for further analysis or reference.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-channel-scraper.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd youtube-channel-scraper
   ```

3. Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed:

   ```bash
   pip install csv
   pip install beautifulsoup4
   ```

4. Run the script by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python youtube_scraper.py
   ```

5. The script will fetch data from the Social Blade website and create a CSV file named 'youtubers.csv' in the same directory with the extracted information.

## Dependencies
